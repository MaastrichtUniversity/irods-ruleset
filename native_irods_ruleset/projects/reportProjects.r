# This rule loops over all projects in iRODS, gets the project details and combines it in 1 large JSON string.
# The outcome can be used for (e-mail) reporting purposes or listing the Projects page in pacman.
# When called as rodsadmin (full permission to /nlmumc/projects) details of all projects are returned.
# When called as user with less privileges, only authorized projects will be returned.
#
# Call with:
# irule -F reportProjects.r
#
# Please note the different usage of size units:
# - bytes are used for the purpose of storing values in iCAT
# - GB is used for the purpose of calculating and displaying costs
# - GiB is used for the purpose of diplaying the size to end-user
